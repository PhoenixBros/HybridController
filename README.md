            pygame https://www.pygame.org/news
            vgamepad https://pypi.org/project/vgamepad/


you will need to install pygame and vgamepad for the code to run
you should know how. but typing into your python console "pip install pygame"  and "pip install vgamepad" should work

The main file takes controller input and a second input that can be manipulated and combines them into 1 virtual coltroller output
The createScheme file can be used to figure out what button your controller uses. or it can be used to create a new mapping of your controller
The last file just shows how to use it
